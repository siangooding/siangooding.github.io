I am a Research Scientist at Google working on Large Language Models (LLMs), my current research focuses on advancing the capabilities of LLMs via techniques such as reinforcement learning and self-refinement. 

Prior to joining Google, I studied for my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk">Computer Laboratory</a> and was a visiting researcher at the <a href= "https://lacclab.github.io">Language, Computation and Cognition Lab</a>.
