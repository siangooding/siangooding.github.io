I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk">Computer Laboratory</a> within the <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/">Natural Language and Information Processing group</a> and a visiting researcher at the <a href= "https://lacclab.github.io">Language, Computation and Cognition Lab</a>.

My PhD [research]({{ 'research.html' | site.relativeurl }}) focuses on readability and text simplification -- the study of how to automatically adapt text to suit the needs of different audiences. For researchers who are interested in this topic please join our<a href="https://join.slack.com/t/textsimplification/shared_invite/zt-9vypl5uq-M7ViTMsnFyGkcuyw_zPOAQ"> TS research slack group</a>!
