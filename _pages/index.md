I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk">Computer Laboratory</a> within the <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/">Natural Language and Information Processing group</a>. I'm originally from Birmingham which is the most amazing city in the world according to the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/10-reasons-birmingham-most-amazing-11661735">Birmingham mail</a>. 

My PhD [research]({{ 'research.html' | site.relativeurl }}) focuses on readability and text simplification -- the study of how to automatically adapt text to suit the needs of different audiences. For researchers who are interested in this topic please join the <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/textsimplification/shared_invite/zt-9vypl5uq-M7ViTMsnFyGkcuyw_zPOAQ">TS research slack group</a>!
