I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk">Computer Laboratory</a> supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=qNP6lAwAAAAJ">Professor Ted Briscoe</a>. My PhD [research]({{ 'research.html' | site.relativeurl }}) focuses on text simplification -- the study of how to automatically adapt text to suit the needs of different audiences. 

I am a member of <a href="https://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk"> Jesus College</a> and a recipient of the <a href ="https://www.caths.cam.ac.uk/harding">Harding Distinguished Postgraduate scholarship</a>.
