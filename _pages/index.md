I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk">Computer Laboratory</a> within the <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/">Natural Language and Information Processing group</a>. I'm originally from Birmingham which is suprisingly easy to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/quizzes/Quiz-Birmingham-or-Venice-can-you-tell-the-difference/">confuse with Venice</a> and is home to the <a href="https://www.cadburyworld.co.uk/en">Cadbury's chocolate factory.</a>

My PhD [research]({{ 'research.html' | site.relativeurl }}) focuses on readability and text simplification -- the study of how to automatically adapt text to suit the needs of different audiences.
