### Curriculum learning for text simplfication 

Humans and animals learn much better when the examples are not randomly presented but organized in a meaningful order which illustrates gradually more concepts, and gradually more complex ones. [1] This has been referred to as <i>curriculum learning</i>. The use of a curriculum learning framework applied to neural machine translation has been shown to reduce training time and result in overall better performance [2]. 

Text simplification (TS) is aimed at reducing the reading and grammatical complexity of text while retaining the meaning and grammaticality. Neural machine translation approaches have dominated the text simplification field over the past few years [3]. In this setting the aim is to 'translate' complex text to simpler text using traditional translation architectures. In this project you will investigate whether curriculum learning can be used to improve NMT approaches to text simplification. You will reimplement a neural translation system and experiment with how the ordering of training data impacts the model performance.
